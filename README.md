# Typing-speed-test

This repository contains a Python-based Typing Speed Test Application. It allows users to test and measure their typing speed by providing a random set of words that need to be typed within a specified time limit. The application calculates the typing speed in words per minute (WPM) and provides feedback on accuracy.

# Features
Randomly generated word sets for each test.
Adjustable time limit for the typing test.
Accurate calculation of typing speed in WPM.
Feedback on accuracy, including error count and percentage.
User-friendly command-line interface.
Easy-to-understand and well-documented code.
